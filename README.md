Test Risk Assessment Program (TRAP) is a program designed to determine the effectiveness of a roadside safety feature by analyzing data from a vehicle crash test of the feature and calculating standardized occupant risk factors.
TRAP calculates occupant risk factors in accordance with the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) guidelines and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN).
